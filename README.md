For this project I used:
* React
* Styled components
* Webpack
* Babel

I chose this stack because I'm very familiar with it. React makes very easy create and mantain SPA's and reusable components. Styled components to help writing CSS for components.

For a bigger project I would probably have also used Redux and Redux-saga.

Redux to global state management and redux-saga to deal with asynchronous actions using generators.

You can see a project where I use those [here]([https://github.com/hugodutra/ergast-api]).
